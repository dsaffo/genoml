# genoml_v2_refactoring
Hi peeps, there's an ongoing TODO_GenoML text file if you want to keep tabs on where I am and where I am going

The workspace folder is the setup I have for my Visual Studio code so if you open it there things should be a lot easier.

I added the necessary example data but to test things the way I am testing them please see the GettingStarted.sh script
